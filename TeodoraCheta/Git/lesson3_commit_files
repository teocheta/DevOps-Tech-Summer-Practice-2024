1. Initialize the repository

-> Create a directory

$ mkdir test-repo

-> navigate there

$ cd test-repo

-> The directory is obviously empty

$ ls -al

-> Now it is time to initialize repository

$ git init

-> Now you should be able to execute status command

$ git status

-> And also the .git directory

$ ls -al

2. Commit first file

$ touch newfile && echo hello > newfile

$ git status

=> new file is untracked

3. Add files

$ git add newfile 

-> to stage changes

=> the file is tracked and ready to be commited

-> if you stage the file once, you don't need to repeat this action again during the work.

4. Commit file

= process to create a revision of the file => version stored in Version Control

$ git commit newfile -m "my first commit"

-m = to add comment

-a = we are able to commit all files from repository. 

By using . we will commit changes from current path recursively

4. Add and commit multiple files

! git add . will add all files from your current directory and subdirectories, not from repository's root. If you are in subdirectory, only files from this path will be added.
