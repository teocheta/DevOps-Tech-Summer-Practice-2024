1. Check the changes

$ git diff = allows to check the differences between HEAD and current working directory. Another words, what was changed during our recent work
-> differences between commit and working directory
-> this command checks HEAD by default

$ git diff HEAD~1

$ git diff HEAD~1 testfile-01 = nformation about testfile-02 only in comparision of current working directory and one commit before HEAD

2. Staged differnces

$ git diff --staged = to see the difference between staged work and HEAD

$ git show
