Git revert:

$ git revert --no-edit HEAD

-> --no-edit we informed git that we don't want to pass any message and we ask to use default
-> We keep the history and logic process of work, however we bring back the part of the work from kind of 'backup'

$ git revert --edit HEAD~3 = to revert multiple commits

--edit = to add commit message

->  HEAD is the current 'place' where we are. For now, let's think about it as combination of current branch and current place in git history
