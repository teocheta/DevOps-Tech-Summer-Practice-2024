How the revert works? It removes changes from selected commit, not from all changes!. Now things should be more clear, right?

change1 commit
change2 commit
revert to change1
That means, we have change2 unattended!

<<<<<< - this is what we have in current branch

====== = center of our conflict

>>>>>> - this wants to be merged / added. In our case this part is empty (as it should be).

$ sed -i '2,5d' testfile-02

We removed mentioned lines. Now the file looks like we want.
