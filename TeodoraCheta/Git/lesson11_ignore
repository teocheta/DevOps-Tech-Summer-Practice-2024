1. .gitignore

-> Git gives us the possibility to control what will be synchronized with remote and what will be not.

We don't want to commit

seconddirectory{{}} directory and its content
neveringit file
But these are in git status, right?

Let's create gitignore file

touch .gitignore

echo neveringit >> .gitignore

echo seconddirectory >> .gitignore

cat .gitignore


2. More configs

**/neveringit
!firstdirectory/neveringit

First line says explicitly - all files anywhere in the structure (and now it is clear, readable and visible)

In second line the exlamation mark negates the pattern. Another words, we negate the deny and allow this file to be sent to remote

-> neveringit file is never added to commit, except only one situation: when we forced it
