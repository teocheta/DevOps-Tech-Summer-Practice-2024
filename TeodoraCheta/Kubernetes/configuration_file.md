## Kubernetes Configuration File Structure

### 1. Metadata
- **Kind**: Specifies the type of Kubernetes component (e.g., Pod, Deployment, Service).
- **Name**: The name of the component.

### 2. Specification
- **Purpose**: Defines every configuration you want to apply.
- **Attributes**: Attributes of `spec` are specific to the `kind` of the component being configured.

### 3. Status
- **Purpose**: Automatically generated and added by Kubernetes.
- **Function**: Compares the desired state with the actual state.
- **Updates**: Continuously updates the state.
- **Source**: Status data is sourced from etcd.

## YAML Configuration Files

- **Indentation**: Strict indentation is required.
- **Storage**: Store configuration files with your code or in your own Git repository.

## Blueprint for Pods

- **Template**: Contains its own `metadata` and `spec`.
- **Purpose**: Serves as a blueprint for creating Pods.
- **Attributes**: Includes specifications like image, name, port, etc.

## Connecting Components

### Labels
- **Definition**: Key-value pairs assigned in the `metadata` of components.
- **Usage**: Used to identify and group components.

### Selectors
- **Definition**: Criteria used to select components based on their labels.
- **Usage**: In the `spec`, selectors match labels to connect components.

### Ports
- **Configuration**:
  - **`containerPort`**: Defined in the Pod specification.
  - **`targetPort`**: Defined in the Service specification, indicating where to forward requests.
  - **`port`**: The port on which the Service is accessible.

- **Connection**: 
  - **Pod's `containerPort`** should match the Service's `targetPort`.
  - **Service's `port`** determines where the Service is accessible externally.
