$ ps = process status

-> session itself and processes executed by the session
-> accepts argument with and without dash.
$ ps a 
$ ps -a
$ ps T
$ ps -A = list of all processes

PID - quite obvious, this is the process id.
TTY - Terminal associated with the process. Here is a very detailed reading about TTY.
TIME - total time of CPU usage
CMD - the command which is running
STAT - state of the process

Statuses:
D - uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
I - Idle kernel thread
R - running or runnable (on run queue)
S - interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
T - stopped by job control signal
t - stopped by debugger during the tracing
X - dead (should never be seen)
Z - defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

Some statuses may have the second letter. Let's list the most important:

< - high-priority (not nice to other users)
N - low-priority (nice to other users)
s - is a session leader
l - is multi-threaded
+ - is in the foreground process group

$ ps -ef = Used mostly when someone wants to determine the PID of the process
$ ps aux =  most important info, like PID, status and resources usage
$ ps aux --forest and $ pstree = used for hierarchy
