$ top

-> first line  = same thing as in w command

top - 19:38:28 up 2 days, 20:47, 0 users, load average: 0.52, 0.58, 0.59

top = program name
19:38:28 = current hour
up 2 days, 20:47 = uptime. Another words, the time from last start of the system.
0 users = number of active users-> similar to command who
load average: 0.52, 0.58, 0.59 = average number of processes running and waiting for CPU time
! these values need to be evaluated very closely with the number of CPUs, Cores, Threads
ex : the nhumber 10 means massive overload when your system has 1 core, but is quite ok when your system has 12 cores

->second line 

Tasks: 6 total, 1 running, 5 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie

total - shows all processes in the system
running - currently active processes. It means, these processes are using CPU right now
sleeping - generally - process is waiting for something. It may be I/O operation for example.
stopped - Stopped processes (for example by ctrl+z)
zombie - a process which had finish his job but still has entry in the process table.
       - these processes are waiting for exit(). It may happen, when parent process deteriorated somehow
       - sometimes we are able to kill zombie (by killing the parrent), but in may cases it will not work


->third line

%Cpu(s): 13.9 us, 9.5 sy, 0.0 ni, 76.3 id, 0.0 wa, 0.4 hi, 0.0 si, 0.0 st

us - user - All user processes are combined in this number. So, our sessions too.
sy - system - processes owned by system (kernel)
ni - nice - nice allows us to change the priority of the process. The standard value for processes is 0 , but we can modify it from 19 (lowest) to -20 (highest) priority. This statistic here shows all processes with the niceness set abow 0. So, the processes which will be executed by the system, when "systemm will have time for it".
id - idle - idle time means that the system is bored and do nothing.
wa - iowait - the number repspresents the time (which is a subset of idle time) when the process is waiting for input/output operation. This statistic is very important, because it may show the issue outside the CPU, in other hardware (but not only) components.
hi - hardware interrupts.
    -physical interrrupts from hardware and are handled by CPU itself.
si - software interrupts.
   - generated by software and are handled by kernel.
st - steal time - represents the time "stealed" from the virtual machine by hypervisor
                -how long our system needs to wait for resources from hypervisor.


->fourth and fifth lines

MiB Mem :  16217.5 total,   6184.9 free,   9808.7 used,    224.0 buff/cache
MiB Swap:  49152.0 total,  48436.2 free,    715.8 used.   6278.3 avail Mem

-memory information : physical and swap memory
buff/cache is a combine value of buffer memory, used by kernel and cache, memory by page cache
available simply means that the new starting program, application, etc can use max this size of memory for its to be run

->processes list

PID - Process ID number. It is unique number of the process in the system.
USER - process' owner. The process is started by this user.
PR - default priority of the process, scheduled by kernel when process was started.
NI - nice. Shows the value, if nice was performed against the process.
VIRT - total amount of memory used by the process.
RES - RAM memory used by process.
SHR - amount of memory shared with other processes.
S - process state (we discussed it above).
%CPU - what amount of available CPU is used by the process.
%MEM - like for CPU, but this value represents memory usage.
TIME+ - total time of CPU usage by the process.
COMMAND - quite obvious, this process is executed.
