Links:

-> shortcuts to original destination/file
-> when you open the link, the system sees it as object opened from the location where it resides, not the original location.

$ ln SOURCE TARGET = creates a link
-> target will be the actual link.

$ ln -s SOURCE TARGET
-> to create a soft link

Soft links:

$ ln -s ../source/file1 softlink
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 May 15 11:20 softlink -> ../source/file1
-> l - informs us that is a link

$ ln -s /root/source/file1 softlink2
-> ls shows us exact object, exact path used to create the link. These two links direct us to the same file, however the paths look different

$ stat softlink

-> Links is still 1. Why? Simple. This is the count of hard links.

$ unlink LINK = to delete a link

-> This link is soft, what means in this case that link is a pointer to the source.
