users in linux:
-standard
-elevated privileges
-root

$ whoami = to see what type of user i am
$ id = User ID (UID), primary group ID (GID) and other groups to which user belongs to.
$ id ubuntu = info about user ubuntu

UID 0 is reserved for root.
1-99 are reserved for predefined accounts (like games, mail, www-data, sys, bin and more)
100-999 reserved for system and administrative accounts.
1000+ are reserved for users

group = abstract which combines many users in similar entity (for the same privileges, purpose, actions, etc)

GID 0 is reserved for root.
1-99 are reserved for system and application use.
100+ are for users.

Files involved in users configurations:
1. passwd
-located in /etc
-structure-> username:password:UID:GID:description:homedir:shell
-shell is the program which takes the commands sent by user, interprets it, and return the answer

$ cat /etc/shells = available shells

2.shadow
-contains sensitive information about the user, like password, and other configurations
-second element = password->if it is set->hashed and not retrievable
                         ->* = no password set
                         ->! = password was never set

3.group
-/etc/group contains information about groups
-structure-> group name
            password
            GID
            users belong to the group

4.gshadow
- encrypted passwords for groups.

Creating user:
$ file =  gives us information about the object
$ command $(another_command) = First, the $(another_command) will be executed. We enforce this by using $() then output of this command will be executed as parameter for command

$ useradd testuser1 = create a new user or update default new user information
$ adduser testuser2 =  add a user or group to the system; more verbose, interactive, asks for password for user and other information 
-password is not set for testuser1
-description is added for testuser2
-testuser1 has sh set and testuser2 - bash as shell.
-testuser1 has the home directory defined, but it is not created

-d - create home directory in specified location, if we want to change

-m - create the home directory

-p - password

-s - provide shell

-c - comments, or description of the account

Moifying user:
$ passwd <user> = to modify password; If user is not provided, the password will be changed for current user
$ usermod testuser3 -g testuser2 = to change group
$ usermod testuser3 -aG 1001 = to add a secondary group
$ usermod testuser3 -d /home/anotherdir  = creates a home directory

In order to properly move home directory (not just create if it doesn't exist, remember adduser without parameters?) we need to add another argument.

$ usermod testuser3 -d /home/newdir -m

$ usermod testuser3 -s /bin/sh = to modify the shell

$ userdel testuser1 = to remove user

$ usermod testuser3 -G "" = to remove secondary groups

r - remove files
f - force removal (in case if files don't belongs to the user)
$ userdel -rf testuser3
