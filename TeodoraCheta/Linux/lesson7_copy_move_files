copy = copy the existing file to new location; source file still available
$ tree sourcedir = recursively shows the content of the directory
$ cp source target = command to copy the file

-> copy a file from one directory to another directory
$ cp one ../targetdir -> from our current location, the target is one level higher -> ..
$ cp one ../targetdir/another-one = copy and change the filename
$ cp two01 two02 ../targetdir = copies files two01 and two02 to targetdir directory
we can use wildcards to copy more files(ex: *, ?)

->copy the whole directory

move = move files from one location to another; source file not available
$ mv sourcedir/one movedfiles
$ mv anotherdir/one movedfiles/another-one = move and change name
$ mv sourcedir/two01 sourcedir/two02 movedfiles = moves files two01 and two02
$ mv anotherdir newdir = move directories
->we can use redirections to copy the content of the file to another file
$ cat .profile > newfilewithcontent.txt =copies content of .profile to newfilewithcontent.txt
$ diff .profile newfilewithcontent.txt = to check if there are differences between the two files ->no output means files are the same
