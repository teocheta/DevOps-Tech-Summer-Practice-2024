Inode
-> a unique identifier for a specific piece of metadata on a given filesystem, and the disk block location of this object

$ df /dev/vda1 = shows info about filesystem

$ df -i /dev/vda1

-> To check inode of specific file, we use -i argument for ls command.
-> A lot of small files might drain all of the inodes (one file, one inode), even if the filesystem is not full. 
-> And the oposite, big files will take all space on filesystem, but there will be plenty unused inodes
