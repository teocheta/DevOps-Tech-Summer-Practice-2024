$ history
$ history | grep cat 
$ history 3 = last 3 commands

Configuration:
-> history is configured somewhere

HISTCONTROL=ignoredups:ignorespace - > if you repeat the same command twice (one by one) only one occurence will be storted in history 
shopt -s histappend -> history file should not be overwritten, but all commands will be stored on the end of the file
HISTSIZE=1000 ->  history available in terminal will keep 1000 records
HISTFILESIZE=2000 -> history kept in history file will contain 2000 records

-> history is kept in .bash_history
-normally written at the end of the session
$ history -a - to dump the session history in the file

We can change the value for this (and only this) session. Let's do it for the file where history is stored:

$ HISTFILE="/root/.another_history"

$ history -c = clears history in memory not files
$ > .another_history = redirects nothing to the file(clears file)

Disable history:

$ set +o history

Disable history for current user:

$ echo 'set +o history' >> ~/.bashrc

And for all users in the system:

$ echo 'set +o history' >> /etc/profile
