root = master of the system
$ su - student1 = to log in as student1
$ exit  = to logout to previous user
$ su -  = root is assumed and you need to give root a password
->root does not have a password set
->root should be accessed only with elevated privileges by allowed users

Elevate privileges:
->su log us as root, sudo elevates our privileges on behalf of root
$  sudo <command> = to run commands as root
$ sudo ps
-> bash is the parent session
-> sudo created its own session, where the ps were finally run
$ sudo -i = to interactively use sudo mode and use elevated privileges in the full session
-> -i argument means that we want to use sudo with login option, another words, to switch the session to privileged one

/etc/sudoers ->to configure sudoers file
root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL = config line for user
%sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL = config line for group

$ update-alternatives --config editor = configure vistudio to use vim
$ vistudio = to edit file /etc/sudoers

Config line:

user pos1=(pos2:pos3) pos4

or

%group pos1=(pos2:pos3) pos4 ->for group

pos1 - applies to all hosts
pos2 - user can use all commands as all users (i.e. root can ls as user03, etc)
pos3 - user can use commads as all groups
pos4 - user can use all commads

su - provide password of the user you want to use
sudo - provide password of current user

configure user with password: student1 ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL ->add it to config file
student2 ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL ->config user without pasword

-> sudoers.d directory for better granulation
::!quit
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d -> means that in order to evaluate sudo config, files in /etc/sudoers.d directory will be used
$ echo "student2 ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/student2

$ echo "student3 ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/student3
