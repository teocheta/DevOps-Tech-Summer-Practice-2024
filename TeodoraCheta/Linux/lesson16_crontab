Cron:

-> a service responsible for control and execution of scheduled tasks
-> started when system is booting and works till the system is shut down
-> service that controls multiple crontabs

$ systemctl status cron.service = to check the status of the service
-> Active: active (running) =  means that service is active

$ ps aux | grep cron = shows processes related to the cron service

Crontab:

->  list of tasks or commands which are scheduled to be executed on specific date and time

1. /etc/crontab  = the system-wide crontab
-> all users can read, but only admins can edit this file
->  system related, admin stuff
-> associated directory - /etc/cron.d -> In this directory we have a few more directories: /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.hourly etc
=>  contain scripts which are executed... daily, hourly, monthly or weekly.
-> How these are executed? =>  four anacron command executed with different scheduling in /etc/crontab
-> anacron = scheduler; doesn't assume that the machine is run continuously without stops

2. /var/spool/cron/crontabs
-> In this directory user's crontabs are stored

Set the task in crontab:

1 17 7 4 2 /usr/bin/ls >/dev/null 2>&1

-> minute defines on which minute scheduler should execute the program. In our example above, it is 1 minute after specified hour.
-> hour defines hour for execution. In our example it is 5PM
-> day of the month as above, but for day in the month. In the example above it is 7th day of the month.
-> month as you can expect, the month. It may be a number, or text. In our example it is 4th month, so April. You can use apr.
-> weekday final option defines the weekday. In our example it is 2, what means Tuesday. Please remember, Sunday can be defined as 0 and 7 as well.

-> if we want to keep every in any of position, we use *

-> user - we do not set user for user related crontabs, it doesn't make any sense, but for system wide crontab this possibility is valuable
-> command

Setting cronjob:

-> cronjob = entry in the crontab

$ crontab -l  = tp list jobs
$ crontab -e = opens crontab editor
ex: 12 9 23 * * /usr/bin/ls -al > logfile 2>&1

Logs:
$ cat /var/log/syslog
$ journalctl -u cron
$ systemctl status cron.service
