What is ls?  
This is the list command. It allows us list the content of the directory.  

the colorized list of content  
ls --color=no  
ls --color=yes  

clear - to clear the screen  

What we pass after the command - these are arguments.  
- one dash informs the system that we will pass one letter argument, like 'l'  
-- two dashes means that argument will contain more than one letter. Most commonly it will be an english word.  

ls -l -> l means long listing format.  
ls -s ->  shows the short list of files and allocated space  
ex: drwx------           3                  root      root        4096    Jul 22 10:19     snap  
   permissions   number of hard links       Owner     Group       Size    date and time of last modification   file name  

ls -a -> listed all the files(+hidden files)    
.  means the current directory of the user.  
.. means parent directory.  

ls -A ->will show all files, except the . and ..(almost all)  

Sorting

-t -> sorts files with the last modification time, newest files come first.  
-tc -> last metadata modification time- permissions change, location of the file, etc  
-lS -> sorts files by size, largest are going first.  
-lh  -> printed the size of the files not in bytes but in K, M, or G.  
        h use the powers of 1024. So, 1K is a 1 powered by 1024.  

ls --format=commas will print the files separated by commas = ls -m  
ls -lQ prints the filenames in quotes  
--time-style changes the way how the date is formated in long format  

ls -al --author prints the username of the creator of the file  
ls -ald prints directories only  
ls -ali prints inodes  
ls -alR recursively prints all subdirectories  
ls -alr prints list in the reversed order  

MAN  
q -> quit  
man 8 ls -> go to the page 8 for ls  
man -f ls -> to see what sections/pages we have available  
man -f intro -> shows us multiple sections available  
whatis ls shows short description of the functionality = man -f ls  

Work with directories  
mkdir filename -> to create a directory  
mkdir testdir{1..10} -> create 10 directories, starting with testdir1 to testdir10
mkdir f1 f2 f3 .... 
mkdir -p parentdir/childdir{01..100} ->with -p we allowed the system to create parent directory and Under the parentdir we created 100 files, from childdir001 to childdir100
cd filename -> In order to change the directory
pwd ->This command shows your current work directory.
cd .. ->We can come back to the previous directory

There is a built-in variable called $HOME. This variable contains the path to the current user home directory 
cd $HOME = cd ~ = cd
rmdir filename -> to remove a directory
rmdir testdir{1..10}

we can remove parent directory only when it is empty
rmdir -p maindir/childdir
rm filename -> to remove a file

rmdir parentdir/*
rmdir parentdir

rm - rf dir ->-r means go recursively through directories (and treat everything as file)
              -f - force. Another words, do not ask, assume the user knows what he is doing.

FILES  

touch filename ->to create an empty file  
touch my{01..100}file  

ls my*file -> * means any string  

touch try1 try2 try01  
ls try? ->means any single character(try1, try2)  

VIM  
vim newfile -> opened a vim editor  
In order to start typing anything in editor (enter insert mode), hit i  
type....  
hit ESC key to enter the command mode, and type :wq  
If you changed something in the file and you don't want to save the changes, press :q!.  

PIPES  
The pipes and redirections are used to send (or retrieve) some information sent from one command or script to another command or script. It works on files too.
The structure looks liKe this:
command1 | command2 | command3

cat numbers.txt ->print the file
cat numbers.txt | wc -l -> print the number of lines in the file
It is important to remember, uniq always works best with sort. And sort is first.
cat numbers.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l

ls -al > directorylist.txt ->redirects all output from the left side of the sign, to the file on the right side of the sign
> will create file (if not exists) and rewrite all data as fresh file. >> behaves similarly, however, if there is any content in the fill, this redirection will add theoutput of the command on the end of existing content.

head testfile ->It we want to print first lines of the file, we can use head. By default head shows 10 lines.

head -n2 testfile -> print only 2 lines

tail testfile
tail does exactly the same thing as heead does, but from the end of the file.

tree sourcedir ->It recursively shows the content of the directory.
cp source target -> copy existing file to the new filename or location
mv sourcedir/one movedfiles -> to move the file from one place to another

TOP  
FIRST LINE  
top - 19:38:28 up 2 days, 20:47, 0 users, load average: 0.52, 0.58, 0.59
top - program name
19:38:28 - current hour
up 2 days, 20:47 - uptime( the time from last start of the system)
0 users - number of active users

who ->  to show who is logged in

load average: 0.52, 0.58, 0.59 ->We see here three numbers. They are representing the load average for the system in last 1, 5 and 15 minutes. These shows the average number of processes running and waiting for CPU time.

w -> for the first line like in top

SECOND LINE  
Tasks: 6 total, 1 running, 5 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie -> information about processes in our system

total - shows all processes in the system
running - currently active processes. It means, these processes are using CPU right now
sleeping - process is waiting for something. It may be I/O operation for example.
stopped - Stopped processes (for example by ctrl+z)
zombie -  It is a process which had finish his job but still has entry in the process table. In simple way, these processes are waiting for exit().

THIRD LINE  
%Cpu(s): 13.9 us, 9.5 sy, 0.0 ni, 76.3 id, 0.0 wa, 0.4 hi, 0.0 si, 0.0 st -> This line shows the CPU(s) utilization, splitted to specific types

us - user - All user processes are combined in this number. So, our sessions too.
sy - system - processes owned by system (kernel)
ni - nice -  allows us to change the priority of the process. The standard value for processes is 0 , but we can modify it from 19 (lowest) to -20 (highest) priority.This statistic here shows all processes with the niceness set abow 0
id - idle - idle time means that the system is bored and do nothing
wa - iowait - the number represents the time (which is a subset of idle time) when the process is waiting for input/output operation
hi - hardware interrupts. These are physical interrrupts from hardware and are handled by CPU itself.
si - software interrupts. These are generated by software and are handled by kernel.
st - steal time -This number represents the time "stealed" from the virtual machine by hypervisor. Another words, how long our system needs to wait for resources from hypervisor

Fourth and fifth lines  
MiB Mem :  16217.5 total,   6184.9 free,   9808.7 used,    224.0 buff/cache  
MiB Swap:  49152.0 total,  48436.2 free,    715.8 used.   6278.3 avail Mem  

buff/cache is a combine value of buffer memory, used by kernel and cache, memory by page cache.  

available simply means that the new starting program, application, etc can use max this size of memory for its to be run.

PROCESSES LIST  
 PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU  %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND                                                      
    652 root      20   0 1800688  43276  30296 S   0.3   2.1   0:00.62 containerd

PID - Process ID number. It is unique number of the process in the system.  
USER - process' owner. The process is started by this user.  
PR - default priority of the process, scheduled by kernel when process was started.  
NI - nice. Shows the value, if nice was performed against the process.  
VIRT - total amount of memory used by the process.  
RES - RAM memory used by process.  
SHR - amount of memory shared with other processes.  
S - process state (we discussed it above).  
%CPU - what amount of available CPU is used by the process.  
%MEM - like for CPU, but this value represents memory usage.  
TIME+ - total time of CPU usage by the process.  
COMMAND - quite obvious, this process is executed.  

How to modify the default view
1 ->The CPU information in line 3 is expanded to single cores. We switch here between the unified view and detailed view.
M ->switch to order by memory usage
N-> the list sorted by PID
T ->order by running time
P ->order by CPU usage

By default our processes list contains the tasks. We can switch it to threads by pressing H (and come back to processes by pressing the same key).
By pressing c we can change between simple name of the command and the full path
v and V shows the tree of processes, instead simple list

u ->is used, we can select one user to list his processes.
  ->we can search through processes. o is case-insensitive and O is case-sensitive.
s->  we can change the refresh rate(default is 3 seconds)
k-> press k and provide the PID of the process to kill
w ->If many settings were changed and we wish to keep them for longer time
  ->the settings will be written in the toprc file in the home directory


PS

ps -> Process status
 we can see these processes, which are related to this specific session only(we see the session itself, and processes executed at this exact moment by this session)
PID - this is the process id.
TTY - Terminal associated with the process. Here is a very detailed reading about TTY.
TIME - total time of CPU usage
CMD - the command which is running.
STAT - It means state of the process

STATUSES  
D - uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)  
I - Idle kernel thread  
R - running or runnable (on run queue)  
S - interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)  
T - stopped by job control signal  
t - stopped by debugger during the tracing  
X - dead (should never be seen)  
Z - defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent  

Some statuses may have the second letter. Let's list the most important  

< - high-priority (not nice to other users)  
N - low-priority (nice to other users)  
s - is a session leader  
l - is multi-threaded  
+ - is in the foreground process group  

ps -A ->list all processes  
ps -ef ->when someone wants to determine the PID of the process  
ps aux ->shows the most important info, like PID, status and resources usage  
to see the hierarchy of processes ->ps aux --forest OR pstree  

ALIASES  
Aliases give us a great possibility to "shape" command line to our needs
alias lh='ls -alh' ->We create an alias called lh and when we invoke it, it should execute the ls -alh command. Now we execute lh.
!!this alias is available in this session only
alias ->shows all defined aliases in the session.
unalias lh -> to remove aliases

To make an alias permanent
echo "alias lh='ls -alh'" >> .bashrc
source ./.bashrc

USERS

whoami->shows the user we are logged in
id ->to learn this information, not only about current user, but any user in the system
(he User ID (UID), primary group ID (GID) and other groups to which user belongs to)

UID ->an unique User Identifier, which identify this user through the system and determine which resources this user can access
UID 0 is reserved for root.
1-99 are reserved for predefined accounts (like games, mail, www-data,sys,bin and more)
100-999 reserved for system and administrative accounts.
1000+ are reserved for users

GID ->as the same meaning, but for group. A group is an abstract which combines many users in similar entity (for the same privileges, purpose, actions, etc)
GID 0 is reserved for root.
1-99 are reserved for system and application use.
100+ are for users.

We have 4 files involved in configuration of users
1. passwd
->It is located, like most of config files, in /etc

The structure of this file is as follows:
username:password:UID:GID:description:homedir:shell

cat /etc/shells -> to see the available shells

2.shadow
This file contains sensitive information about the user, like password, and other configurations
3. group
ontains information about groups
The structure is as follows:

group name
password
GID
users belong to the group

4.gshadow
This file contains encrypted passwords for groups.

which show us where the executable is located
file gives us information about the object

adduser uses useradd when creates user.aadduser is interactive. It asks for password for user and other information
useradd testuser1
adduser testuser2

password is not set for testuser1
description is added for testuser2
testuser1 has sh set and testuser2 - bash as shell.
Well, testuser1 has the home directory defined, but it is not created.

Let's go through most important arguments, which we should consider to use during create of new user.
-d - create home directory in specified location, if we want to change
-m - create the home directory
-p - password
-s - provide shell
-c - comments, or description of the account

Change the password
grep testuser3 /etc/shadow
passwd testuser3

usermod testuser3 -g testuser2
we modified the primary group for testuser3. Right now it is testuser2
We can use GID also, not just name:

usermod testuser3 -g 1001

usermod testuser3 -aG testuser1
we added the secondary group 1001

usermod -d we can create a home directory
usermod testuser3 -d /home/newdir -m

usermod testuser3 -s /bin/sh ->to modify the shell

userdel testuser1-> to delete a user
userdel -rf testuser3 ->In order to remove the files

History in command line

history
!6 ->executa a 6a comanda din history
history 3 ->will show 3 last commands stored in history.
history -c ->to clear history
set +o history -> to disable history
If we wish to disable history for current user:

echo 'set +o history' >> ~/.bashrc

And for all users in the system:

echo 'set +o history' >> /etc/profile

Elevate privileges
When we log in to Linux we are "normal" user. With limited access to programs, directories, etc.
Root is a master of the system. Root can do everything. Simply, it is an admin
su ->to use another user
su - student1

Let's check student1 is sudo is configured for him.
su - student1
sudo ps

As mentioned, /var/log is the default location in all Linux systems for logs
syslog->The main system log. Contains all important information about the system and applications.
auth.log->Contains information about authorizations. All user login attempts (with information if successful or not), logout, password changes, remote logins and use of sudo
dmesg->is a kernel ring buffer, not the log.It allows us to interact with kernel and get information by querying bootup messages.

kern.log->Stores Kernel messages
boot.log-> information about started services, applications, disks configurations and so on.
lastlog	-> Contains information abount last logins
faillog	-> use this file with faillog utility. Logs fails, like login failures
wtmp.log->Contains login infomration. However, it doesn't show information similar to lastlog, but used by other utilities, like who
dpkg.log->Contains data about packages management - install, remove, update, etc
cat /var/log/dpkg.log ->how to check a log
logger "This is a test message" -> to push a message in log

STREAMS  
There is a command line with prompt waiting for interacting with you. This interaction is executed by two streams - output and input.

First stream is called standard input.In short, we use the name STDIN.Its file descriptor is 0.
When STDIN is waiting for instructions passed to it, standard output displays responses from the system (in the simplest scenario). Its file descriptor is 1 and we name it STDOUT.
The third stream is somehow special. It is standard error, with 2 as file descriptor. We call it STDERR.in this way we can differentiate the actions taken when output from our scripts are correct or there are some errors.

cat notexists.txt 2> errorfile ->to redirect an error

/dev/null ->a virtual file to which we can write(we cannot read)- like a void

cat notexists.txt 1> catfile 2> errorfile ->we directed STDOUT to catfile and if we had an error we write it to errorfile

cat notexists.txt > capture.txt 2>&1 ->capture STDOUT and STDERR in the same file
This uses the &> redirect instruction. This instruction allows you to tell the shell to make one stream got to the same destination as another stream

CRONTAB  
cron is a service responsible for control and execution of scheduled tasks. It is started when system is booting and works till the system is shut down.  
So, to conclude this part, cron is a service which controls multiple crontabs  

crontab is simply a list of tasks or commands which are scheduled to be executed on specific date and time.  
/etc/crontab -> the system wide crontab.all users can read, but only admins can edit this file.  
In this directory we have a few more directories.  
/etc/cron.daily  
/etc/cron.hourly  
/etc/cron.monthly  
/etc/cron.weekly  
These directories contain scripts which are executed... daily, hourly, monthly or weekly.  
We have four anacron command executed with different scheduling. An anacron is a scheduler too. Unlike the cron, anacron doesn't assume that the machine is run continuously without stops.  

Example:  
1 17 7 4 2 /usr/bin/ls >/dev/null 2>&1 ->a crontab  
-minute ->it is 1 minute after specified hour.  
-hour ->defines hour of execution(17)  
-day of the month(7)  
-month(apr)  
-weekday
in our example, system will execute the command at 17:1 on 7th of April. But only if it will be Tuesday.  
If we set day/month, we generally not set weekday. The same in oposite direction.  
If we want to keep every in any of position, we use *(So, if we set 15 * as two first elements, it means: execute 15 minutes after every hour)
